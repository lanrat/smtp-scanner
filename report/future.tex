\section{Future Work}
Due to the time constraints of this project only a small sample of a few million domains, a larger sample of the entire internet, especially if ranked by region could provide good insight into that state of secure email communication on an country by country basis.

A follow up study collecting the same data would allow us to see how the adoption of TLS for SMTP is changing.

In addition to TLS, SMTP can also make use of Sender Policy Framework (SPF) records for authentication of email origin, and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) to verify message integrity. A study of SPF and DKIMâ€¦.zz

Determine reason for Microsoft not supporting TLS. In our preliminary investigation, we could find no good reason as to why they would not support the option. Ideally, we would like to get in touch of the hotmail team to see if we can get an answer to this question directly.

Explore alternatives to SMTP for email communication. An ideal mail protocol would provide end-to-end email encryption. Not only would such a protocol provide stronger data security and integrity, but it could also alleviate large scale spam issues.
