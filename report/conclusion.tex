\section{Conclusion}
We have shown that a significant percentage of email providers today do not support TLS for encrypting incoming email traffic.  Unfortunately, some of those providers are among the most popular email providers, resulting in nearly half of email users receiving, and possibly sending, emails across the internet in plaintext.  Furthermore, we have shown that not all providers use encryption even when the destination domain supports it, resulting in an even smaller percentage of users whose emails are secured.  Our hope is that these results will illuminate the need for wider adoption of the current standards for email encryption, and perhaps someday a rethinking of mail transfer protocols.
